# Slowdive-CD-Raffle

This is an HTML code snippet for a (mock) Slowdive CD Raffle. The webpage includes a form where users can enter their email address to participate in a raffle. The raffle item is an image of a Slowdive CD album cover that is displayed on the page. The webpage uses CSS styles to align and center the elements on the page. The form submits to a URL provided in the action attribute of the form element. The webpage is intended to be used as a part of a larger project, and can be added to a Github readme or other web-based documentation.
